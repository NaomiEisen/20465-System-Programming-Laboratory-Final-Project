# Assembler Project in C90 ðŸ¤Ÿ

This project is the final assignment for the course **'Laboratory C'** in the Open University of israel :)

## Overview
The assembler converts an assembly file into an object file, as well as additional extern and entry files.
The assembler follows a two-phase process:
1. **Preprocessing**: Expands macros and prepares the input file for further processing.
2. **First Phase**: Checks syntax, generates the symbol table, and translates all instructions that do not depend on labels.
3. **Second Phase**: Handles the translation of the remaining instructions and generates the output files.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into folders, each containing 'headers' and 'sources' files for different components:

### assembler
This folder contains files responsible for the entire assembling process, including:

- **preprocessor**: Prepares the input file by handling macros and file includes.
- **parser**: Analyzes each line of the assembly file, validates syntax, and prepares instructions for processing.
- **first_pass**: Handles the first phase of the assembler, during which the lable table is generated and the eligible assembly instructions are being translated to machine code.
- **second_pass**:  Completes the second phase by converting the remaining assembly instructions into machine code and generating the extern and entry files.
- **assembler_controller**: Coordinates all stages of the assembly process
- **code_convert**: Manages the binary conversion of assembly instructions.
- **assembler**: The main file that launches the program.

### Data Structures
This folder contains files defining various data structures and their associated methods used throughout the project:

- **ast**: Abstract Syntax Tree. Represents an assembly instruction in all its possible formats.
- **trie**: A generic Trie data structure used to create efficient data structures, allowing fast insertion and searching based on string values.
- **macro_data**: A data structure for storing macros, implemented using the generic Trie structure.
- **label_data**: A data structure for storing labels, including their name, address, and type, also built on the generic Trie structure.
- **mappings**: Structures that store data about assembly instructions and reserved keywords.
- **cmp_data**: Represents the "imaginary" computer's memory and data needed for file processing. It includes two memory sectionsâ€”data and code, that grow towards each other, allowing flexible management of the shared maximum capacity. Additionally, it stores label structures, external/entry files, and a list of unresolved lines for the second assembly phase.
- **error**: A structure for handling errors during execution. It contains error codes, their corresponding messages, and a location structure indicating where the error occurred.

### Utils
Contains utility functions and structures used throughout the project.

- **Boolean**: Defines boolean enums for clarity and simplicity. 
- **output_files**: Handles the writing of processed data to output files.
- **utils**: Provides various utility functions for handling strings, integers, and file name extensions.
