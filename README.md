# Assembler Project in C ðŸ¤Ÿ

This project is the final assignment for the course **'Laboratory C'** in the Open University of israel :)


## âœ§ Overview âœ§ 
The assembler converts an assembly file into an object file, as well as additional extern and entry files.
The assembler follows a two-phase process:
1. **Preprocessing**: Expands macros and prepares the input file for further processing.
2. **First Phase**: Checks syntax, generates the symbol table, and translates all instructions that do not depend on labels.
3. **Second Phase**: Handles the translation of the remaining instructions and generates the output files.

## âž­ Assembly Syntax
The assembly language instructions used in this project are described below:
### â­‘ Two Argument Instructions â­‘
| Instruction       | Description                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **mov** | Moves data from the source operand to the destination operand. |
| **cmp** | Compares two operands and updates the status flags based on the result. |
| **add** | Adds the value of the source operand to the destination operand. |
| **sub** | Subtracts the value of the source operand from the destination operand. |
| **lea** | Loads the effective address of the source operand into the destination operand. |

### â­‘ One Argument Instructions â­‘
| Instruction       | Description                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **clr** | Clears the value of the operand, setting it to zero. |
| **not** | Inverts all bits of the operand. |
| **inc** | Increments the operand by one. |
| **dec** | Decrements the operand by one. |
| **jmp** | Unconditionally jumps to the specified address. |
| **bne** | Jumps to the specified address if the previous comparison result was not equal. |
| **red** | Reads a value from the input and stores it in the operand. |
| **prn** | Prints the value of the operand. |
| **jsr** | Jumps to a subroutine at the specified address and stores the return address for later use. |

### â­‘ No Argument Instructions â­‘
| Instruction       | Description                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **rts** | Returns from a subroutine, resuming execution at the return address stored on the stack. |
| **stop** | Halts the program execution. |

### â­‘ Registers â­‘
There are 8 registers used in this project, named `r0` to `r7`. These registers are used for storing temporary data and performing calculations. Each register can hold a value, and they are referenced in assembly instructions to perform operations like loading, storing, and arithmetic operations. 

â¤· The actual execution of the assembly instructions is not relevant to the project, so a detailed understanding of each instruction is not required for completing the translation. However, it is useful to have a basic understanding of the types of operations the assembler supports. :)

## âž­ Project Structure

The project is organized into folders, each containing 'headers' and 'sources' files for different components:

### â­‘ assembler â­‘
This folder contains files responsible for the entire assembling process, including:

- **preprocessor**: Prepares the input file by handling macros and file includes.
- **parser**: Analyzes each line of the assembly file, validates syntax, and prepares instructions for processing.
- **first_pass**: Handles the first phase of the assembler, during which the lable table is generated and the eligible assembly instructions are being translated to machine code.
- **second_pass**:  Completes the second phase by converting the remaining assembly instructions into machine code and generating the extern and entry files.
- **assembler_controller**: Coordinates all stages of the assembly process
- **code_convert**: Manages the binary conversion of assembly instructions.
- **assembler**: The main file that launches the program.

### â­‘ Data Structures â­‘
This folder contains files defining various data structures and their associated methods used throughout the project:

- **ast**: Abstract Syntax Tree. Represents an assembly instruction in all its possible formats.
- **trie**: A generic Trie data structure used to create efficient data structures, allowing fast insertion and searching based on string values.
- **macro_data**: A data structure for storing macros, implemented using the generic Trie structure.
- **label_data**: A data structure for storing labels, including their name, address, and type, also built on the generic Trie structure.
- **mappings**: Structures that store data about assembly instructions and reserved keywords.
- **cmp_data**: Represents the "imaginary" computer's memory and data needed for file processing. It includes two memory sectionsâ€”data and code, that grow towards each other, allowing flexible management of the shared maximum capacity. Additionally, it stores label structures, external/entry files, and a list of unresolved lines for the second assembly phase.
- **error**: A structure for handling errors during execution. It contains error codes, their corresponding messages, and a location structure indicating where the error occurred.

### â­‘ Utils â­‘
Contains utility functions and structures used throughout the project.

- **Boolean**: Defines boolean enums for clarity and simplicity. 
- **output_files**: Handles the writing of processed data to output files.
- **utils**: Provides various utility functions for handling strings, integers, and file name extensions.

### â­‘ Execution Report â­‘
The Execution_Report folder contains examples of program execution, showcasing:

**Sample Assembly Files**: Example inputs and their expected outputs.
**Generated Outputs**: Object files, extern files, and entry files created by the assembler.
**Memory Management Reports**: Logs confirming no memory leaks, verified using tools like valgrind.

## âž­ How to Run
### On Linux (using the Makefile)
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
2. Compile the project by running:
```bash
   make
```
 Note: A preconfigured Makefile is included for your convenience. 
3. Execute the program with the following command:
   ```bash
   ./assembler_exe <input_file>
```
Replace <assembly_file_name> with the name of your assembly file, without the file type extension.

### On an IDE (using CMakeLists)
1. Open your IDE (e.g., CLion) and load the project directory.
2. Ensure the **CMakeLists.txt** file is properly configured in the root folder.
3. Build the project using the IDE's build option.
4. To run the program on specified files:
   - Go to the **Run/Debug Configurations** menu.
   - Add the name(s) of the assembly file(s) (`<assembly_file_name>`) **without the file type extension**, separated by spaces if you want to run multiple files.
   - Run the program.
